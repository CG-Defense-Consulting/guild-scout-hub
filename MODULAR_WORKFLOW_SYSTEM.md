# Modular Workflow System

## Overview

The Modular Workflow System is a new architecture that addresses the inefficiency of spinning up environments (Python, ChromeDriver, etc.) for each individual workflow execution. Instead, it provides a framework for chaining reusable operations together and sharing resources across multiple tasks.

## Key Benefits

### **1. Resource Efficiency**
- **Chrome Setup Once**: Chrome and ChromeDriver are initialized once and shared across multiple operations
- **Environment Reuse**: Python environment and dependencies are loaded once per workflow
- **Reduced Overhead**: Eliminates the startup time for each individual task

### **2. Modular Design**
- **Reusable Operations**: Common tasks are packaged as reusable operations
- **Flexible Chaining**: Operations can be combined in different ways to create workflows
- **Dependency Management**: Clear definition of operation dependencies and execution order

### **3. Batch Processing**
- **Efficient Iteration**: Operations can be applied to batches of items
- **Reduced API Calls**: Database operations are batched for better performance
- **Scalable Processing**: Handle large numbers of items efficiently

### **4. Flexible Composition**
- **Mix and Match**: Combine operations in any order or sequence
- **Loop Control**: Carefully control loops and iterations
- **Parallel/Serial**: Run operations in parallel or series as needed

### **5. Use Case Focus**
- **Business-Driven**: Workflows are named and defined based on business use cases
- **Implementation-Agnostic**: Use case workflows use modular operations under the hood
- **Conditional Logic**: Apply business rules to determine what operations to run

## Architecture Components

### **1. Base Operation (`BaseOperation`)**
The foundation class that all operations inherit from:

```python
class BaseOperation(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str = ""):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.status = OperationStatus.PENDING
        self.dependencies = []
        self.required_inputs = []
        self.optional_inputs = []
    
    @abstractmethod
    def _execute(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], context: Dict[str, Any]) -> OperationResult:
        pass
    
    def can_apply_to_batch(self) -> bool:
        return hasattr(self, 'apply_to_batch')
```

**Features:**
- Input validation
- Status tracking
- Dependency management
- Batch processing support
- Comprehensive error handling

### **2. Operation Types**

#### **Chrome Setup Operation (`ChromeSetupOperation`)**
- Initializes Chrome and ChromeDriver once
- Stores driver instance in shared context
- Configurable options (headless, download directory, etc.)
- Automatic fallback to service-based initialization

#### **Consent Page Operation (`ConsentPageOperation`)**
- **Reusable consent handling** for any operation that needs it
- Detects and handles DLA consent pages
- Configurable consent button selectors
- Can be applied to batches of URLs
- **Key Benefit**: Eliminates duplicate consent handling code across operations

#### **NSN Extraction Operation (`NsnExtractionOperation`)**
- **Focused solely on data extraction** with integrated closed status checking
- Extracts multiple field types: AMSC codes, descriptions, part numbers, manufacturers, CAGE codes
- **Integrated closed status detection**: Checks for "no open solicitation" language while extracting data
- Configurable field extraction
- **Key Benefit**: Combines data extraction with closed status detection in one operation

#### **Closed Solicitation Check Operation (`ClosedSolicitationCheckOperation`)**
- **Dedicated operation** for checking if solicitations are closed
- Configurable text patterns for detection
- Can be reused by any operation that needs closed status
- **Key Benefit**: Centralized logic for closed status detection

#### **Supabase Upload Operation (`SupabaseUploadOperation`)**
- Handles database uploads efficiently
- Processes batch results from previous operations
- Updates AMSC codes and closed status
- Configurable batch sizes for database operations

### **3. Workflow Orchestrator (`WorkflowOrchestrator`)**
Manages the execution of operation chains:

```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str = ""):
        self.steps = []
        self.context = {}
        self.status = WorkflowStatus.PENDING
    
    def add_step(self, operation, inputs=None, depends_on=None, batch_config=None):
        # Add operation to workflow
        pass
    
    def execute(self, initial_context=None):
        # Execute workflow steps in order
        pass
```

**Features:**
- Dependency validation
- Circular dependency detection
- Context sharing between operations
- Batch step execution
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Use Case-Focused Workflows

### **Universal Contract Queue Data Pull**

**Use Case**: Pull comprehensive data for contracts in the universal contract queue
**Implementation**: Uses modular operations with specific business logic

#### **Business Logic Implementation**

The workflow implements the exact business logic specified:

```python
def analyze_contract_data_gaps(self, contract_ids: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    This implements the specific business logic:
    1. Check RFQ PDF existence first
    2. If PDF doesn't exist, check AMSC code status
    3. Apply conditional logic based on both conditions
    """
    
    for contract_id in contract_ids:
        # FIRST: Check if RFQ PDF exists in Supabase bucket
        rfq_pdf_exists = self.check_rfq_pdf_exists(contract_id)
        
        if rfq_pdf_exists:
            # RFQ PDF exists - do nothing
            contract_gaps['should_process'] = False
            contract_gaps['action_reason'] = 'RFQ PDF already exists in bucket'
            
        else:
            # RFQ PDF does NOT exist - check AMSC code status
            existing_amsc = contract_data.get('cde_g')
            
            if not existing_amsc:
                # AMSC code is empty - extract AMSC code AND download RFQ PDF
                contract_gaps['needs_amsc'] = True
                contract_gaps['needs_rfq_pdf'] = True
                contract_gaps['should_process'] = True
                contract_gaps['action_reason'] = 'RFQ PDF missing AND AMSC code empty - will extract both'
                
            else:
                # AMSC code is filled but RFQ PDF is missing - do nothing
                contract_gaps['should_process'] = False
                contract_gaps['action_reason'] = 'RFQ PDF missing but AMSC code exists - PDF issue, not touching'
```

#### **Conditional Logic Applied**

The workflow applies business rules to determine what operations to run:

```python
# For each contract, determine what data is missing:
for contract_id, gaps in contract_gaps.items():
    if gaps.get('should_process', False):
        # Only process contracts that need both AMSC code AND RFQ PDF
        if gaps.get('needs_amsc') and gaps.get('needs_rfq_pdf'):
            # Add NSN extraction operation (includes closed status checking)
            workflow.add_step(nsn_extraction)
            
            # Add RFQ PDF download operation
            workflow.add_step(rfq_pdf_download)
```

#### **Workflow Structure**

```
Chrome Setup (once)
↓
Analyze Contract Data Gaps
├── Check RFQ PDF existence in Supabase bucket
├── If PDF exists: Do nothing
├── If PDF missing AND AMSC empty: Process
└── If PDF missing BUT AMSC exists: Do nothing (PDF issue)
↓
Conditional Operations (only for contracts that need processing):
├── Consent Page Handling (batch)
├── NSN Data Extraction (includes closed status detection)
└── Supabase Upload (AMSC codes + closed status)
```

#### **Integrated Closed Status Detection**

The NSN extraction operation now includes closed status checking as specified in the business logic:

```python
def _check_closed_solicitation_status(self, driver, nsn: str) -> Optional[bool]:
    """
    Check if the solicitation is closed by looking for specific text patterns.
    
    This method checks for the specific language mentioned in the business logic:
    "No record of National Stock Number: {NSN} with open DIBBS Request For Quotes (RFQ) solicitations."
    """
    
    # Look for the specific closed solicitation pattern
    closed_pattern = f"No record of National Stock Number: {nsn} with open DIBBS Request For Quotes (RFQ) solicitations."
    
    if closed_pattern in page_source:
        logger.info(f"NSN {nsn}: Closed solicitation detected via specific pattern")
        return True
    
    # Look for other indicators of closed/open solicitations
    # ... additional pattern matching logic
```

## Flexible Workflow Composition

### **Example: Chrome Setup + Loop [Consent → Extract NSN (with closed status) → Upload]**

```python
def create_universal_contract_queue_workflow(contract_ids: List[str]):
    workflow = WorkflowOrchestrator("universal_contract_queue_data_pull")
    
    # Step 1: Chrome Setup (runs once, shared across all operations)
    chrome_setup = ChromeSetupOperation(headless=True)
    workflow.add_step(chrome_setup)
    
    # Step 2: Consent Page Handling (applied to batch of NSNs that need processing)
    consent_page = ConsentPageOperation()
    workflow.add_step(
        consent_page,
        depends_on=['chrome_setup'],
        batch_config={'items': nsn_urls}
    )
    
    # Step 3: NSN Data Extraction (includes closed status checking)
    nsn_extraction = NsnExtractionOperation()
    workflow.add_step(
        nsn_extraction,
        inputs={'check_closed_status': True},  # Enable closed status detection
        depends_on=['consent_page'],
        batch_config={'items': nsn_list, 'contract_ids': contract_ids}
    )
    
    # Step 4: Supabase Upload (AMSC codes and closed status)
    supabase_upload = SupabaseUploadOperation()
    workflow.add_step(
        supabase_upload,
        depends_on=['nsn_extraction']
    )
    
    return workflow
```

### **Alternative Workflow Patterns**

You can easily create different workflow patterns:

```python
# Pattern 1: Process each NSN completely before moving to next
workflow.add_step(consent_page, batch_config={'items': nsn_list})
workflow.add_step(nsn_extraction, batch_config={'items': nsn_list})
workflow.add_step(supabase_upload)  # All results at once

# Pattern 2: Process all NSNs through each operation type
workflow.add_step(consent_page, batch_config={'items': nsn_list})
workflow.add_step(nsn_extraction, batch_config={'items': nsn_list})
workflow.add_step(supabase_upload)  # Batch upload of results

# Pattern 3: Custom operation combinations
# You can create custom operations that combine multiple steps
# if you want to process each NSN completely before moving to the next
```

## Usage Examples

### **1. Command Line Usage**
```bash
# Pull data for contracts in universal contract queue
python workflows/adhoc/universal_contract_queue_data_pull.py \
    --contract-ids abc123 def456 ghi789 \
    --force-refresh \
    --timeout 45 \
    --retry-attempts 5 \
    --batch-size 100 \
    --verbose
```

### **2. Programmatic Usage**
```python
from core.operations import (
    ChromeSetupOperation, 
    ConsentPageOperation, 
    NsnExtractionOperation,
    SupabaseUploadOperation
)
from core.workflow_orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator

# Create workflow
workflow = WorkflowOrchestrator("custom_workflow")

# Add operations in any order you want
workflow.add_step(ChromeSetupOperation(headless=True))
workflow.add_step(
    ConsentPageOperation(),
    depends_on=['chrome_setup'],
    batch_config={'items': ['NSN1', 'NSN2', 'NSN3']}
)
workflow.add_step(
    NsnExtractionOperation(),
    inputs={'check_closed_status': True},  # Enable closed status detection
    depends_on=['consent_page'],
    batch_config={'items': ['NSN1', 'NSN2', 'NSN3']}
)
workflow.add_step(
    SupabaseUploadOperation(),
    depends_on=['nsn_extraction']
)

# Execute
results = workflow.execute()
```

### **3. GitHub Actions Integration**
```yaml
name: Universal Contract Queue Data Pull
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      contract_ids:
        description: 'Comma-separated list of contract IDs from universal_contract_queue'
        required: true
        type: string
      force_refresh:
        description: 'Force refresh even if data already exists'
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: false
```

## Performance Improvements

### **Before (Individual Workflows)**
```
NSN 1: Setup Chrome → Extract AMSC → Upload → Cleanup
NSN 2: Setup Chrome → Extract AMSC → Upload → Cleanup
NSN 3: Setup Chrome → Extract AMSC → Upload → Cleanup
...
Total: 3 × (Setup + Extract + Upload + Cleanup) = 12 operations
```

### **After (Modular Workflow)**
```
Setup Chrome → Extract AMSC (Batch) → Upload (Batch) → Cleanup
Total: 4 operations
```

### **Efficiency Gains**

## Conclusion

The Modular Workflow System provides a robust, efficient framework for building complex workflows that:

1. **Eliminate Resource Waste**: Share expensive resources across operations
2. **Improve Performance**: Reduce setup/teardown overhead
3. **Enhance Maintainability**: Modular, reusable components
4. **Support Scalability**: Efficient batch processing
5. **Ensure Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
6. **Enable Flexibility**: Mix and match operations with loops and sequences
7. **Focus on Use Cases**: Workflows address business needs, not technical operations
8. **Implement Business Logic**: Apply specific conditional rules for data processing

This system addresses the core inefficiency of the previous approach while providing a foundation for building more sophisticated automation workflows in the future. The abstraction of operations like consent handling and closed status checking makes the system more modular and allows for flexible workflow composition as requested.

The key insight is that **workflows are named and defined based on business use cases** (like "Universal Contract Queue Data Pull"), while the **actual implementation uses the modular operations** we've defined (Chrome Setup, Consent Page, NSN Extraction, etc.). This separation allows for business-focused workflow design while maintaining technical flexibility and reusability.

### **Business Logic Implementation**

The Universal Contract Queue Data Pull workflow now implements the exact business logic specified:

1. **FIRST check if RFQ PDF exists** in Supabase bucket
2. **If RFQ PDF does NOT exist**:
   - Check if AMSC code is empty
   - If AMSC code is empty: Extract AMSC code AND download RFQ PDF
   - If AMSC code is filled: Do nothing (PDF issue, don't touch)
3. **If RFQ PDF exists**: Do nothing (already processed)
4. **While extracting AMSC code**, if we see "no open solicitation" language, mark as closed

This business logic is now fully implemented in the workflow, ensuring that only contracts that actually need processing are processed, and that the appropriate operations are run based on the specific data gaps identified.
